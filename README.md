# Project6-AutoLayout
Auto Layout seems easy at first, then it gets tiring, then it gets fun to learn. 
Here, the challenges were to replace the widthAncor with leadingAnchor and trailingAnchor constraints; use safeAreaLayoutGuide for those constraints; and make the height of the labels equal to 1/5th of the main view, minus 10 for the spacing.
